# SegM8 API

## `class SegM8`

Create an object of type `SegM8` to communicate with a chain of particular [SegM8 7-segment indicator modules](https://my.amperka.com/modules/SegM8).

### `SegM8(uint8_t pinCS, uint8_t deviceCount = 1)`

Constructs a new SegM8 object that uses the default hardware SPI bus.

- `pinCS`: the *chip select* (also known as *slave select*) pin is used to control the shift-register latch. It is marked **CS** on the SegM8 board. Any GPIO pin of the controller may be used.
- `deviceCount`: the number of SegM8 modules connected in a daisy-chain. If omitted, defines a single module.

### `SegM8(uint8_t pinCS, uint8_t pinDI, uint8_t pinCLK, uint8_t deviceCount = 1)`

Constructs a new SegM8 object that uses a software SPI bus.

- `pinCS`: the *chip select* (also known as *slave select*) pin is used to control the shift-register latch. It is marked **CS** on the SegM8 module. Any GPIO pin of the controller may be used.
- `pinDI`: the *data input* pin used to send data to the peripherals. It is marked **DI** on the SegM8 module. In SPI terms known as **MOSI** (Master Out Slave In). Any GPIO pin of the controller may be used.
- `pinCLK`: the *clock* pin is used to clock pulses that synchronize data transmission generated by the master. It is marked **CLK** on the SegM8 module. Also known as **SCK** in SPI terms. Any GPIO pin of the controller may be used.
- `deviceCount`: the number of SegM8 modules connected in a daisy-chain. If omitted, defines a single module.

The difference between hardware and software SPI is interaction speed. Software SPI runs slower than hardware SPI but hardware SPI works only on specific board pins: **MOSI**, **MISO** (not used in SegM8) and **SCK**.

### `void begin()`

Initializes the given interface, clear internal buffer, and sets all module segments to the «dark» state.
Call this method before interacting with SegM8. For example, in the `setup()`.

### `void clear()`

Sets all module segments to the «dark» state. Clear internal buffer.

### `void display(int number, uint8_t position, uint8_t width, uint8_t flags = SEGM8_ALIGN_RIGHT)`

### `void display(unsigned int number, uint8_t position, uint8_t width, uint8_t flags = SEGM8_ALIGN_RIGHT | SEGM8_RADIX_10)`

### `void display(long number, uint8_t position, uint8_t width, uint8_t flags = SEGM8_ALIGN_RIGHT)`

### `void display(unsigned long number, uint8_t position, uint8_t width, uint8_t flags = SEGM8_ALIGN_RIGHT | SEGM8_RADIX_10)`

### `void display(float number, uint8_t position, uint8_t width, uint8_t precission = 1, uint8_t flags = SEGM8_ALIGN_LEFT)`

### `void display(const char* string, uint8_t position, uint8_t width, uint8_t flags = SEGM8_ALIGN_LEFT)`

### `void display(String string, uint8_t position, uint8_t width, uint8_t flags = SEGM8_ALIGN_LEFT)`

Prints fixed `width` number or text line to the `position` of output buffer, using formatting `flags`. Moves the contents of the buffer to the indicator daisy-chain Note: the `.` sign does not occupy a separate module at the output, but is displayed in the previous module.

When printing text strings, the interpretation of characters in indicator segments is used; for unsupported characters **K, M, N, V, W, X, Z**, an `underscore` is displayed (segment **a**).

- `number`: integer or floating point numbers.
- `string`: text line.
- `position`: starting position of the output of a string or number in the internal buffer.
- `width`: the number of elements of the internal buffer, and, accordingly, SegM8 modules, necessary for the number or text representation.
- `precission`: decimal places count of a float.
- `flags`: formatting flags. You can add somewhat consistent flags separated by `|` sign.

Available formatting flags:

- `SEGM8_ALIGN_RIGHT` — align to right corner. Default state.
- `SEGM8_ALIGN_LEFT` — align to left corner
- `SEGM8_PAD_ZEROS` — add leading zeros before the number. Compatible only with SEGM8_ALIGN_RIGHT.
- `SEGM8_RADIX_10` — use radix 10. Default state.
- `SEGM8_RADIX_16` — use radix 16, only for unsigned int numbers.

### `void writeSegments(uint8_t mask, uint8_t deviceIndex = 0)`

Displays a custom symbol in the specified position.

- `mask` — an 8-bit array. The ordinal number of the member of this array corresponds to the letter index of an indicator segment: 0–a, 1–b, <...>, 7–h(dot).
- `deviceIndex` - A SegM8 device number in the daisy-chain. Can be in the range [0 : deviceCount−1].
